Where to Corrupt:
  The BIOS should only be corrupted between 0xbfc18000 -> 0xbfc80000.
  Should be anywhere, take notes of what it does.

------------------------------------------------------
How to use and some info:
   This corruption values document should be used in a hex editor.
   In HxD, press CTRL+G and enter the values on the beginning of a corruption value.
   Then for example "61B04 - Unknown Reverb set addr. from 56 to 93 *o", the first value (56) is the original one and the second value (93) is the modified value, the *o (*letter) is the credit whoever made the corruption.
   The format is Address - Description set addr. from *default* to *changed value* *letter

------------------------------------------------------

Note: (As of December 26, 2024) I have put the credits to remaining ones that doesn't have (*letter) yet.
But the actual author who made the corruptions is forgotten exactly, so it'll be replaced with (*o). 
(As of January 18, 2025) I will put more yt channel links to credits, and including linktree.
(As of January 21, 2025) I will put version numbering starting at 1.4.1.
