# Diamond
## Diamond allows the user, without complex knowledge of editing BIOS ROM files using a hex editor, to make changes into the PlayStation's imagery and auditory files inside the BIOS ROM.

The program allows users to, among other things:

- Change the colour of the spheres (at least the main one)
- Change the colour of the main menu gradient buttons
- Add custom VAG (Audio Format)
- Add custom TIM (Image Format) into the logo

Diamond is in active development and should not be expected to work properly. Proceed with caution!
